In a team of 3 people, designed and developed an analogue musical synthesiser with possible real-life application on LTSpice software. The synthesiser consists of a VCO capable of producing three types of waveforms (triangle, square, sine), a VCF allowing high-pass, low-pass and band-pass filtering as well as a VCAM which along with the LFO enables the user to modulate the output signal (Attack â€“ Release (AR) enveloping and Ring Modulation).
