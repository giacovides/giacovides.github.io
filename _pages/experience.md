#### Financial Signal Processing Lab, Imperial College London (Mar 2023 - Sep 2023)

##### *Undergraduate Researcher*
- Implemented code in order to web-scrap automatically thousands of financial news articles
from online sources and apply NER filtering as well as pre-processing and feature extraction.
- Main part of the project involves performing different sentiment analysis approaches
to construct NLP-based bond portfolios. These include both lexicon-based approaches as well
as deep-learning approaches where LLMs and GNNs will be employed.
- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses LLMs and GNNs
in the considered context

#### Imperial College London (Jul 2022 - Sep 2022)

##### *Undergraduate Research Assistant (UROP)*
- Designed models using MATLAB and Simulink for the control of grid-tied DC/DC Converters
and DC/AC inverters focusing on Modular Multilevel Converters (MMC) for use in VSC-HVDC applications.
- Employed several algorithms/sub-systems to improve the accuracy and robustness of the
models including PID and PIR controllers, park PLL systems, PWM generation with dead-time
and filtering techniques.

#### KIOS Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence (Jul 2021 - Sep 2021)

##### *Research Assistant*
- Part of the EU-funded C-AVOID project aiming to improve road safety by exploiting 5G networks
to coordinate autonomous vehicles.
- Employed signal processing techniques/algorithms such as edge detection and Kalman filtering to
calculate the live distance between vehicles through perfect localization (precision of 20cm)
using ArUco markers.
- Utilised extensively Python packages and libraries in OpenCV including SciPy and NumPy.

#### National Guard of Cyprus (Jul 2019 - Sep 2020)

##### *Sergeant Major*
- Responsible for 10 soldiers coming from diverse environments and with different qualifications.
- Planning the day-to-day activities, daily shifts, and weekly exits of soldiers from the camp.
