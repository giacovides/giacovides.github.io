#### Financial Signal Processing Lab, Imperial College London (Mar 2023 - Sep 2023)

##### *Undergraduate Researcher*
-

#### Imperial College London (Jul 2022 - Sep 2022)

##### *Undergraduate Research Assistant (UROP)*
- Designed models using MATLAB and Simulink for the control of grid-tied DC/DC Converters
and DC/AC inverters focusing on Modular Multilevel Converters (MMC) for use in VSC-HVDC applications.
- Employed several algorithms/sub-systems to improve the accuracy and robustness of the
models including PID and PIR controllers, park PLL systems, PWM generation with dead-time
and filtering techniques.

#### KIOS Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence (Jul 2021 - Sep 2021)

##### *Research Assistant*
-Part of the EU-funded [C-AVOID] (https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/c-avoid) project aiming to improve road
safety by exploiting 5G networks to coordinate autonomous vehicles.
-Employed signal processing techniques/algorithms such as edge detection and Kalman filtering to
calculate the live distance between vehicles through perfect localization (precision of 20cm)
using ArUco markers.
-Utilised extensively Python packages and libraries in OpenCV including SciPy and NumPy.

#### National Guard of Cyprus (Jul 2019 - Sep 2020)

##### *Sergeant Major*
- Responsible for 10 soldiers coming from diverse environments and with different qualifications.
- Planning the day-to-day activities, daily shifts, and weekly exits of soldiers from the camp.
