Hi! I'm Giorgos, a 3rd year MEng Electrical and Electronic undergraduate at Imperial College London graduating in 2024. For my 4th and final year, I have been selected by my department to attend MIT as an exchange student. I am currently undertaking a 6-month undergraduate research placement in the Financial Signal Processing (FSP) Lab at my university under the supervision of Professor Danilo Mandic. The core of my research involves employing sentiment analysis techniques using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as part of constructing NLP-based bond portfolios.

My main interests lie in the areas of digital signal processing, deep learning and electrical energy systems. I am a highly motivated individual, who is always eager to learn and enjoys being in a research environment contributing to the design and development of cutting-edge technology. My previous work experience involves working as a research assistant at two prestigious institutions, being selected to be a technical student at my countryâ€™s electricity authority, tutoring over 100 STEM students and being a sergeant major during my mandatory military conscription duty. Through these, I have gained valuable skills, notably team-working, communication, resilience, leadership, and time-management.
